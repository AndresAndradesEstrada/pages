     <h1 class="ancestor1">Finances Today</h1>
       
     <p class="content one">AI and the finance industry are a match made in heaven. The financial sector relies on accuracy, real-time reporting and processing high volumes of quantitative data to make decisions, all areas intelligent machines excel in.
          <p class="content two">As the industry takes note of AI's efficiency and accuracy, it is rapidly implementing automation, chatbots, adaptive intelligence, algorithmic trading and machine learning into financial processes.  
             <p class="content three">One of the biggest financial trends of 2018 is the robo-advisor, an automated portfolio manager.
               <p class="content four">These automated advisors use AI and algorithms to scan data in the markets and predict the best stock or portfolio based on preferences. Wealth management firms are turning towards robo-advisors, not only because it saves both the company and client time and money, but it also produces some extraordinary returns.
                  <p class="content five">Here are a few examples of how artificial intelligence is changing the financial industry.

       <p>Betterment's robo-advisors use algorithms to automate tax loss harvesting, trading, transactions and portfolio management, all tasks that used to require a lot of human elbow grease and know-how.</p>
       <p>Betterment has $10 billion worth of assets under management and as of last year was serving 250,000 customers. </p>
    
    <h2 class="subtitle type2" id="type2">AlphaSense</h2>
         <img src="../images/alphasense.png" alt="alphasense banner">

    <p>Using a combination of linguistic search and natural language processing, the program can analyze key data points across 35,000 financial institutions.

    </p>
    
    <h2 class="subtitle type3" id="type3">Numerai</h2>
         <img src="../images/numerai.png" alt="numerai banner">

      <p>Numerai is an AI-powered hedge fund using crowdsourced machine learning from thousands of data scientists around the world.</p>
      <p>The company releases abstracted financial data to its community of data scientists, all of whom are using different machine learning models to predict the stock market.</p> 
      <p>The models are pitted against one another in a weekly tournament where creators compete for Numeraire (NMR), the company's cryptocurrency. The most accurate predictions make it to the top of the leaderboard and are awarded more tokens.  </p>
      <p>But Numerai isn't really about rewarding winners and losers.  The competition is simply a way to collect more models. The company's real breakthrough is in how it synthesizes all of the varying approaches into a "Meta Model."</p>
       <p><strong>Industry impact</strong> The company is top secret about the makeup of the fund, its clients and performance, but has more than 35,000 data scientists contributing to its platform and has paid out some $15 million worth of its cryptocurrency.</p>
