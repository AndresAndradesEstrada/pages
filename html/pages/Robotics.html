        <h1>Robotics Technologies</h1>

         <p>Industry leaders still can’t agree on what the term “robot” embodies. Roboticists understand robots to be programmable machines that carry out tasks, but nobody can pinpoint exactly where that definition ends.</p>
          
         <p>Today's AI-powered robots, or at least those machines deemed as such, possess no natural general intelligence, but they are capable of solving problems and "thinking" in a limited capacity.</p>
         
         <p>From working on assembly lines at Tesla to teaching Japanese students English, examples of artificial intelligence in the field of robotics are plentiful.</p>

        <p>The Hanson-created Sophia (pictured above) is an incredibly advanced social-learning robot. Through AI, Sophia can efficiently communicate with natural language and use facial expressions to convey human-like emotions.</p>
         
        <p>Sophia has become something of a media celebrity over the past few years, featured on various talk shows, including a memorable appearance with a clearly weirded-out Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show. The robot has even accepted citizenship from Saudi Arabia.</p>
       
        <p>Hanson plans to introduce an entire line of robots like Sophia, which they believe "have immediate applications as media personalities in movies and TV shows, entertainment animatronics in museums and theme parks, and for university research and medical training applications."  </p>
