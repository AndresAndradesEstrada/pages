     <h1>Day to day with AI</h1>
    
         <p>Artificial intelligence is technology in which machines are given the ability to perform tasks that normally require humanlike thinking. Types of AI include machine learning and neural networks. It has a broad range of possible uses in transportation, health care, entertainment, education, agriculture, manufacturing, cybersecurity, and national defense.</p>

         <p>Current uses are “narrow AI,” where the system does one specific task, such as recognizing images. In contrast, a “general AI” system would work more broadly and uses more of the human abilities to learn and to apply that knowledge to new areas. True general AI is unlikely to be achieved for decades.</p>

         <h2>How it is used?</h2>   
     
         <p>Common products and services that rely on AI today include spam filters that analyze large quantities of email and learn which ones are likely to be junk. Robotic vacuums figure out the best route for cleaning a home. Virtual assistants, such as Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri, understand commands to play music, tell us the weather, and shop online.</p>
 
         <p>Businesses are adopting AI technologies, including retailers who use it to do a better job of forecasting demand and to cut supply-chain waste. Farmers use autonomous equipment to sample soil, plow, and plant. Some have begun to use tracking devices that can predict if their dairy cows are getting sick. Ride-sharing businesses use AI to match passengers with drivers. Finacial companies analyze transactions with AI to help them spot fraud. A Canadian company that uses AI to track infectious diseases spotted the coronavirus before authorities announced an outbreak. </p>

     <h2>Concerns about AI</h2>
        
         <p>Though AI holds enormous potential, some observers are concerned about protecting people’s privacy. It can require large amounts of data, which might be stolen in a breach or repurposed in ways the user never intended.</p>

         <p>Bias is another concern. If the data is incomplete or biased, the results the system produces are likely to be skewed or inaccurate. For example, some companies had begun using AI to comb through resumes and help make hiring decisions. Now some of those employers are rethinking the technology after research indicated the systems could be biased against women and minorities. If few woman have held a job in the past, the computer might downgrade the applications of new female candidates. A process known as “explainable AI” tries to minimize bias by having the system explain its rationale for its inferences and results. This may help developers to identify and remove biases from the system.</p>
