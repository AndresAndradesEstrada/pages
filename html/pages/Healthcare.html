         <p>Artificial intelligence is proving to be a game-changer in healthcare, improving virtually every aspect of the industry from robot-assisted surgeries to safeguarding private records against cyber criminals.</p>
         <p>Healthcare has long suffered from skyrocketing medical costs and inefficient processes. Artificial intelligence is giving the maligned industry a much-needed makeover.</p>
         <p>AI-enabled virtual assistants are reducing unnecessary hospital visits and giving nurses 20% of their time back in the process; workflow assistants are helping doctors free up 17% of their schedules; pharmaceutical companies are researching lifesaving medicines in a fraction of the time and cost it traditionally takes; and AI is even being used to help bring healthcare to underdeveloped nations.</p>
         <p>Here are a few examples of how artificial intelligence is streamlining processes and opening up innovative new avenues for the healthcare industry.</p>
     
    
         <h2>Covera Health</h2>
         <p>Covera Health is utilizing collaborative data sharing and applied clinical analysis to reduce the number of misdiagnosed patients throughout the world. The company’s proprietary technology utilizes a framework that combines advanced data science and artificial intelligence to sort through existing diagnostics to provide practitioners with more accurate symptom data when making a decision that will have a major impact on a patient’s life — reducing cascading effects of misguided care and saving the healthcare industry hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>

    <h2>Well</h2>
         
        <p>Well allows people to live better lives and receive the medical guidance they need quickly, allowing them to make more informed decisions about the care they receive.</p>
        <p>Driven by a proprietary AI-driven “health engine” that helps personalize health guidance to each user, Well guides people through the right health journey based on their pre-existing conditions, ongoing health concerns and gaps in general health knowledge. The health engine combines both personal and external health data to provide informed advice based on other user experiences while also providing points that can be redeemed at stores for completing challenges and supporting communities, helping users with everything from screenings and questionnaires through prescription support, vaccination advice, recommended doctors visits and specific condition guidance.</p>
